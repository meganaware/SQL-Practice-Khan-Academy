# SQL-Practice-Khan-Academy
This repository contains a compilation of the challenges and projects that I completed throughout the Khan Academy course "Intro to SQL: Querying and managing data". Coursework included guided practice in SQL basics, more advanced SQL queries, relational queries in SQL, and modifying databases with SQL.
