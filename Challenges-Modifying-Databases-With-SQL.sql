We've created a database for a documents app, with rows for each document with it's 
title, content, and author.
*/

/*CHALLENGE: Clothing alterations
We've created a database of clothes, and decided we need a price column. 
Use ALTER to add a 'price' column to the table. 
Then select all the columns in each row to see what your table looks like now.

should be 20 dollars, item 3 should be 30 dollars. When you're done, do another 
SELECT of all the rows to check that it worked as expected.
